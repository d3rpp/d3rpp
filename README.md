<em>Also be sure to checkout my Gitlab at <a href="https://gitlab.com/d3rpp">gitlab.com/d3rpp</a></em>

**All my "work" work is on the Company Gitlab Instance so you probably wont see much here other than the few personal projects i have time for**

**Cider is (at least for now) a closed source application so you will most likely not see it here**
