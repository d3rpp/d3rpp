### <a href="https://github.com/d3rpp/nnz" target="_blank">The NurtureNZ Web-App</a>
This is the official Web-App for my [NCEA](https://ncea.education.govt.nz) Level 3 Business Studies Project of creating and Selling Flexible Baking Mixes, this uses [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) in order to store recipes and show them to end users, this project was initially written in AngularJS but has since been moved to ReactJS

This is the unofficial crew management solution made for the Takapuna Grammar School Rowing Club. made as a part of my NCEA Level 3 Computer Science Project, it is made using Typescript, Typescript and SCSS, compiled with [Parcel](https://v2.parceljs.org)

<!-- ### <a href="https://github.com/d3rpp/Onyx" target="_blank">The Onyx Game Engine (BIG WIP)</a>
This is a game engine in the planning, it'll be written entirely in rust that has planned support for MacOS, Windows and Linux and possibly later expanding to X-Box, Playstation, Nintendo Switch, iOS/iPadOS and Android. Taking advantage of `rust`'s powerful feature set in order to optimise build per platform (e.g. the MacOS release will only contain code for [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) and not [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org) and the Windows Release will not contain any [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) Code. This takes advantage of [Spir-V](https://www.khronos.org/spir/) for this -->
