- [Cider Developer](https://cider.sh)

Later in life I'm aiming to get some certs and move towards network engineering, hopefully being able to use my programming knowledge to create netowking tools but who knows lmao. Either way, Network Engineering

<em>Also be sure to checkout my Gitlab at <a href="https://gitlab.com/d3rpp">gitlab.com/d3rpp</a></em>

**All my "work" work is on the Company Gitlab Instance so you probably wont see much here other than the few personal projects i have time for**

**Cider is (at least for now) a closed source application so you will most likely not see it here**
